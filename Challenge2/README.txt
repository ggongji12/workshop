This is the explaination of my first Java console game


//        Generate a random number and ask the user to guess the number
//        continue asking until you receive the number
//        after 5 times of guessing show a game over message
//
//        - Show a welcome message
//        - Ask the user's name and say hello to the user
//        - Ask if we should start the game
//        - After receiving a positive answer generate a random number and ask
//        for the user's guess'
//        - If the guess is correct show a congratulations message and quit
//        - If number is incorrect, ask again until correct answer
//        - as a hint when the user guesses ask for higher or lower number
//        except the first try
//        - If the user failed 5 times, show a game over message and quit the game
